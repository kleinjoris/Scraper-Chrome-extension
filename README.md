# Web Scraper

Web Scraper is a chrome browser extension built for data extraction from web
pages. Using this extension you can create a plan (sitemap) how a web site
should be traversed and what should be extracted. Using these sitemaps the
Web Scraper will navigate the site accordingly and extract all data. Scraped
data later can be exported as CSV or JSON Lines.
